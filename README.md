# The Smart Activist's Guide to Security:
### How to Build an Activist Organization Scratch
A few weeks ago I gave my sister a copy of "The Smart Girl's Guide to Privacy" by Violet Blue https://www.nostarch.com/smartgirlsguide

She still hasn't read it... but, whatever... let's face it, she was more likely to read that than say, "Information Security for Journalists" by Silkie Carlo and Arjen Kamphuis http://www.tcij.org/resources/handbooks/infosec

Around the same time I read, "The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World From Scratch" by Lewis Dartnell http://the-knowledge.org/en-gb/the-book/

The Knowledge isn't a 'security' or 'survival guide'. It's essentially a 'thought experiment' that examines, "What key knowledge would you need to start rebuilding civilization from scratch?". Quite interesting once you get past the zombie apocalypse style introduction.

In an odd way, it reminded me of "Data and Goliath" by Bruce Schneier https://www.schneier.com/books/data_and_goliath/ and "Cypherpunks" by Julian Assange, et al http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/cypherpunks/

Also talks such as, "OPSEC for Freedom Fighters" by the The Grugq https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaYdCdwiWU and "Towards (reasonably) trustworthy x86 laptops" by Joanna Rutkowska https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7352-towards_reasonably_trustworthy_x86_laptops

Although the subject is completely different, like the security books and talks above, The Knowledge gives a broad perspective without drilling down into the 'how-tos'. I don't really need to read a step-by-step guide to smelting iron (at this stage).

There are already some excellent security 'how-tos' such as, "Surveillance Self-Defense" by EFF https://ssd.eff.org/ and "Security In-a-Box" by Tactical Technology Collective https://securityinabox.org/

"The CryptoParty Handbook" https://www.cryptoparty.in/learn/handbook was a great resource.

What seems to be missing is a Smart Girl's Guide to Privacy or The Knowledge style introduction to Cyber Security and OpSec specifically aimed towards activists.

I'm not suggesting another 'Use Tor! Use Signal!' nor a step-by-step guide to installing Qubes https://www.qubes-os.org/ and encrypting USB drives.

Like the thought experiment in The Knowledge, I wonder, "What elements of security should be considered in building an activist organization from scratch?"

These issues are often talked about in InfoSec circles but I've never seen a broad prespective presented in a readable form for non-technical activists.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I just wanted to put it out there.
